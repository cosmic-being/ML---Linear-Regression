#Salary Prediction

It has 2 columns — “Years of Experience” and “Salary” for 30 employees in a company. 
We will train a Linear Regression model to learn the correlation between the number of years of experience of each employee and their respective salary. 

First, the data is split into 7:3 ratio so that the 70 per cent data shall be used for training and the rest of the data for testing.
